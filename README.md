# 📚 SQL Project: Online Bookstore Data Analysis

Welcome to my SQL project based on a structured **Online Bookstore Database**.  
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to manage, analyze, and extract meaningful business insights from transactional data.

---

## 🗞️ Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and analyzing an **Online Bookstore relational database** using **PostgreSQL**.  
The database captures information related to **books, customers, and orders**, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management, customer behavior analysis, and sales performance evaluation.

The project includes:
- Database creation and table design
- Data import from CSV files
- 30 analytical SQL queries
- Business-focused insights with clear explanations

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The database consists of **3 core tables**:

- **Books**  
  Stores book details such as title, author, genre, price, published year, and stock quantity.

- **Customers**  
  Contains customer information including name, email, phone number, city, and country.

- **Orders**  
  Records customer purchases by linking books and customers, along with order date, quantity, and total amount.

This simplified structure is designed to represent a single-book purchase per order for learning and analysis purposes.
